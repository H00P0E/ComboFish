# Abouth the project:
A fun little project I made to gain exprience in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

In this project I challanged myself to make a simple browser game.


# How to play:
Position the hook on fish and click [SPACE] button to catch.

Catch 3 fishes in a row to unlock a combo point multiplier.
Careful! An unsucessful attempt to catch a fish breaks the streak.
